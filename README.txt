A simple prime stress test written in Rust

Firstly id like to say, this is my first time using GitHub, so if ive done something wrong with the upload just notify me if you can and i'll try and fix it.

Rust isnt my first language (limited programming in it so far) and so perhaps it isnt written as well as it should be, again im open to suggestions and insight on how to be a better programmer in Rust, and in general really.

Run program at command prompt level.

PrimeThreads.exe [number_of_threads] //the default is 10,000,000 prime numbers which is a great start on stressing multi core processors. PrimeThreads.exe [number_of_threads] [total_numbers_to_search]
